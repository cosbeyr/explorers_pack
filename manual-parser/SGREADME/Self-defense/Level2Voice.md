You should really understand what things to say and how in different situations. For example, there's a technique that's based on one of our social instincts - conforming. When someone's angry and his speech is very loud and fast address a few words or a small sentence to him with the same voice and then start to speak calm and slow. Also, when you're attacked use your voice to attract other people's attention. When in a crowd and someone wants to show how "tough" he is say something like "Hey, I don't want any trouble" out loud. That not only may help you when things get jurisdictional, but also have a higher chance of someone from the crowd to react (interesting thing, if someone intrudes that doesn't "hurt" the attacker's status, you know, "hey, if not that stupid grandpa, I would have beaten that guy for sure"). Plus, you might remind the guy that you (actually both of you), obviously, don't want to fight. Again, every situation is different, this info may just give you a better understanding of what logic to apply when you're trying to get out of sketchy circumstances. Just explore human interaction either by reading specific books or practicing. Practicing is better, but that doesn't mean you should go and search for some trouble to solve.
