That is tricky. If you don't know where and how hard you're hitting you might easily apply level 6 at level 5 and the other way around. In both cases, you might be in real trouble. That means I cannot give any short advice on these two levels. If you're seriously thinking about it then read the book, consult with professionals etc. Every page about those two levels in the book I've read is completely important. If you want to base your knowledge and experience only on this article the only thing that's recommended about level 5 is that, since the best option is to run, it makes sense to disable the threat from chasing you. That is when in a fight or before it's, clearly, about to start a very good target to hit is outside or inside a knee. It's especially effective when the threat is moving thus shifting all weight to one leg. Even if standing on both legs, kicking in the out/inside of a knee knocks the attacker off balance and gravity does the rest of the job. Not only you buy some time by knocking down, but it is also probable that the threat is not able to run. Very good technique.
