Industrially produced "pure" aluminium (such as soda cans or aluminium foils) allows the making of more powerful cells, especially when paired with activated charcoal. A 10cm by 10cm cell made of these materials, with salt water electrolyte, produce 1V and 100mA.

Activated charcoal is usually used to filter aquarium water. Well burnt regular charcoal will be efficient too, once reduced to large grain powder, in order to contain the maximum air in it.

To make an aluminium-air cell, cut a 10cm by 10cm aluminium foil piece. Lay salt water soaked paper on it. Set a 1cm thick charcoal layer on the soaked paper. Put a bare copper wire across the carbon. Fold the edges of the aluminium foil, like you would close a burrito. The copper wire must not touch the aluminium. Press on the aluminium burrito to activate it. The volts appear between the copper wire (being the positive pole) and the aluminium foil (negative one).

The drawback here is that aluminium gets oxidized within tens of minutes. Aluminium oxidation sticks on the aluminium part, preventing the reaction from continuing. The aluminium anode can be mechanically brushed to remove oxidation or bleach can be added to the salt water to reactivate the cell.
