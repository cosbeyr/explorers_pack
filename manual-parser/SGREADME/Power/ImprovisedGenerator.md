You can use almost any DC motor to generate electricity. All you must do is turn the motor by hand or by other means and electricity will be generated at the (+) and (-) leads of the motor. (The electricity produced will be in the form of AC, so a diode/rectifier is required to make use of the generated electricity to charge a battery).

The faster the motor turns, the higher the voltage produced will be. The current produced will depends on the internals of the motor. Generally the bigger and more difficult the motor is the turn, the more current it will produce.

Motors that do not work for this are most fan motors, and motors that do not have magnets in them. If the motor is magnetic without being plugged in, chances are it will work.

Microwave oven turntable motors (the one that turns the glass plate on the bottom) can easily produce 300-400 volts when turned by hand.
