You can also use a car or truck with a combustion engine to generate power. Cars and trucks (hereafter referred to as "car") always come with a generator in the form of an alternator that recharges the car's battery and provides power to the car's systems while the engine is running. When the engine is running, power is being produced. Most car batteries are 12V. You just have to convert the 12V to 5V for the phone. You can really easily build this yourself cheaply e.g. with a LM7805 Voltage Regulator IC or you buy a [car usb-charger](CarUSBCharger). But be aware that this is a wildly inefficient means to produce power, as the majority of the output is being used to power the car itself. You also hurt the environment when doing so, as the vehicle is being powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. This should be the last resort as a car is making 80% of heat energy (usually from fossil fuel) using just 20% to actually move you around, and an accessory converts a small portion of this movement into electricity via average efficiency converters. It is much better to take advantage of this while driving to your destination, as the power is there anyway.
