Associated with fear is anxiety. Because it is natural for you to be afraid it is also natural for you to experience anxiety. Anxiety can be an uneasy, apprehensive feeling you get when faced with dangerous situations (physical, mental, and emotional). When used in a healthy way, anxiety can urge you to act to end (or at least master) the dangers that threaten your existence. If you were never anxious there would be little motivation to make changes in your life. In a survival setting, you can reduce your anxiety by performing those tasks that will ensure you come through the ordeal alive. As you reduce your anxiety you also bring under control the source of that anxiety: your fears. In this form anxiety is good; however, anxiety can also have a devastating impact. Anxiety can overwhelm you to the point where you become easily confused and have difficulty thinking. Once this happens, it will become increasingly difficult for you to make good judgements and sound decisions. To survive you must learn techniques to calm your anxieties and keep them in the range where they help, not hurt.
