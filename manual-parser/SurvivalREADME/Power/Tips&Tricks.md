**Power-Bank**

Get a good power-bank. Often you do not want to use the energy directly while still generating it. Let's take solar - you may charge your power-bank during the day, and may use the power at night. Be aware that the capacity information on these power-banks are often inaccurate or outright lies. Try them out for yourself and measure.

Power banks are just batteries with standard plug interfaces (e.g. USB, 5V). Beware that owning a battery is like owning a pet animal: you're responsible for it. If you fail to comply with proper maintenance, it will have a shortened life. Classic cellphone power-banks are made of Lithium batteries, which are better stored at 50% capacity (being full or empty is damaging it), and recharge every 6 months. It won't work properly (or at all) after years of oblivion deep in a drawer.

**AC/DC Conversion**

Converting from AC to DC (known as rectification) is easy and can be done with a single component. Almost every device that plugs into a mains socket will contain a bridge rectifier (AC->DC converter). This will be marked with these four symbols: '~ ~ + -' (any order, always four connectors).

Apply AC to the '~ ~' connectors and you will get DC form the '+ -' connectors.

Converting from DC to AC (known as inversion) is always much less efficient, and requires a complex device (power inverter) that cannot be improvised.

**Save Power**

You do not have to generate the power you save. A big help in saving power is measuring what device consumes how much energy in which state. For example, your phone consumes a lot more energy when the radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular) are switched on. Also, the brightness of the display plays a big role in its battery life.

You will use around 1% of your battery every minute of full power screen backlight, camera session, or WiFi download. And in uncovered areas, your phone will keep trying to reach a cellphone antenna around which drains a lot of power.

To save your battery you should set it up with low screen backlight level, short screensaver timeout and airplane mode enabled.

**Batteries**

There are 6 types of batteries you're likely to encounter in the wild:
