These are the best batteries for power storage, they can be found in cars and industrial flood lights.They have moderately-high total power, and some can provide extremely massive currents (car batteries).They decay at a moderate rate, but if kept stationary and at 100% charge by a constant trickle of slightly higher voltage, they can last indefinitely.They require adding water to prevent them from drying out. Charging them slowly dries up the water inside.They have serious hazards to watch out for. When dead, they contain water and lead. Lead is poisonous if ingested.When charged, they contain sulfuric acid, which can burn you.They will not survive being dropped or repeated physical shock.
