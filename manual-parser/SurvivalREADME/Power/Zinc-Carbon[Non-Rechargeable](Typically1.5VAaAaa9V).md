Cheaper batteries particularly 9V use Zinc-Carbon based cells.They are 1.5V fully charged but are very low in total power and provide low current.They also decay quickly when not being used, so older unused Zinc-Carbon batteries are usually near dead.They are slightly irritating if you get the contents on your bare skin, but nothing to be alarmed about.
