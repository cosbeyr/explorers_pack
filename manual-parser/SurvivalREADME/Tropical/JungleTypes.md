There is no standard jungle. The tropical area may be any of the following:* Rain forests.* Secondary jungles.* Semievergreen seasonal and monsoon forests.* Scrub and thorn forests.* Savannas.* Saltwater swamps.* Freshwater swamps.**TROPICAL RAIN FORESTS**The climate varies little in rain forests. You find these forests across the equator in the Amazon and Congo basins, parts of Indonesia, and several Pacific islands. Up to 3.5 meters (12 feet) of rain falls throughout the year. Temperatures range from about 32 degrees C (90 degrees F) in the day to 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) at night.There are five layers of vegetation in this jungle ([Figure 14-1](#fig14-1)). Where untouched by man, jungle trees rise from buttress roots to heights of 60 meters (198 feet). Below them, smaller trees produce a canopy so thick that little light reaches the jungle floor. Seedlings struggle beneath them to reach light, and masses of vines and lianas twine up to the sun. Ferns, mosses, and herbaceous plants push through a thick carpet of leaves, and a great variety of fungi grow on leaves and fallen tree trunks.<a name="fig14-1"></a>![Figure 14.1\. Five Layers of Tropical Rain Forest Vegetation](fig14-01.png)**Figure 14-1\. Five Layers of Tropical Rain Forest Vegetation**Because of the lack of light on the jungle floor, there is little undergrowth to hamper movement, but dense growth limits visibility to about 50 meters (165 feet). You can easily lose your sense of direction in this jungle, and it is extremely hard for aircraft to see you.**SECONDARY JUNGLES**Secondary jungle is very similar to rain forest. Prolific growth, where sunlight penetrates to the jungle floor, typifies this type of forest. Such growth happens mainly along riverbanks, on jungle fringes, and where man has cleared rain forest. When abandoned, tangled masses of vegetation quickly reclaim these cultivated areas. You can often find cultivated food plants among this vegetation.**SEMIEVERGREEN SEASONAL AND MONSOON FORESTS**The characteristics of the American and African semievergreen seasonal forests correspond with those of the Asian monsoon forests. The characteristics are as follows:* Their trees fall into two stories of tree strata. Those in the upper story range from 18 to 24 meters (60 to 79 feet); those in the lower story range from 7 to 13 meters (23 to 43 feet).* The diameter of the trees averages 0.5 meter (2 feet).* Their leaves fall during a seasonal drought.Except for the sago, nipa, and coconut palms, the same edible plants grow in these areas as in the tropical rain forests.You find these forests in portions of Columbia and Venezuela and the Amazon basin in South America; in portions of southeast coastal Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique in Africa; in Northeastern India, much of Burma, Thailand, Indochina, Java, and parts of other Indonesian islands in Asia.**TROPICAL SCRUB AND THORN FORESTS**The chief characteristics of tropical scrub and thorn forests are as follows:* There is a definite dry season.* Trees are leafless during the dry season.* The ground is bare except for a few tufted plants in bunches; grasses are uncommon.* Plants with thorns predominate.* Fires occur frequently.You find tropical scrub and thorn forests on the west coast of Mexico, the Yucatan peninsula, Venezuela, and Brazil; on the northwest coast and central parts of Africa; and in Turkestan and India in Asia.Within the tropical scrub and thorn forest areas, you will find it hard to obtain food plants during the dry season. During the rainy season, plants are considerably more abundant.**TROPICAL SAVANNAS**General characteristics of the savanna are that it:* Is found within the tropical zones in South America and Africa.* Looks like a broad, grassy meadow, with trees spaced at wide intervals.* Frequently has red soil.* Grows scattered trees that usually appear stunted and gnarled like apple trees. Palms also occur on savannas.You find savannas in parts of Venezuela, Brazil, and the Guianas in South America. In Africa, you find them in the southern Sahara (north-central Cameroon and Gabon and southern Sudan), Benin, Togo, most of Nigeria, northeastern Republic of Congo, northern Uganda, western Kenya, part of Malawi, part of Tanzania, southern Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and western Madagascar.**SALTWATER SWAMPS**Saltwater swamps are common in coastal areas subject to tidal flooding. Mangrove trees thrive in these swamps. Mangrove trees can reach heights of 12 meters (39 feet). Their tangled roots are an obstacle to movement. Visibility in this type of swamp is poor, and movement is extremely difficult. Sometimes, streams that you can raft form channels, but you usually must travel on foot through this swamp.You find saltwater swamps in West Africa, Madagascar, Malaysia, the Pacific islands, Central and South America, and at the mouth of the Ganges River in India. The swamps at the mouths of the Orinoco and Amazon rivers and rivers of Guyana consist of mud and trees that offer little shade. Tides in saltwater swamps can vary as much as 12 meters (3 feet).Everything in a saltwater swamp may appear hostile to you, from leeches and insects to crocodiles and caimans. Avoid the dangerous animals in this swamp.Avoid this swamp altogether if you can. If there are water channels through it, you may be able to use a raft to escape.**FRESHWATER SWAMPS**You find freshwater swamps in low-lying inland areas. Their characteristics are masses of thorny undergrowth, reeds, grasses, and occasional short palms that reduce visibility and make travel difficult. There are often islands that dot these swamps, allowing you to get out of the water. Wildlife is abundant in these swamps.
