The environment is the key to the types of items you will need in your survival kit. How much equipment you put in your kit depends on how you will carry the kit. A kit carried on your body will have to be smaller than one carried in a vehicle. Keep the most important items on your body. For example, your map and compass (also in the form of apps from **Chapter Apps** on your phone) should always be on your body, as should a lighter and a multi-tool as descrived in **Chapter Multi-Tool**.In preparing your survival kit, select items that are multipurpose, compact, lightweight, durable, and most importantly, functional. An item is not good if it looks great but doesn't do what it was designed for. Items should complement each other from layer to layer. A signal mirror in your pocket can be backed up by pen flares in your LBE and a signal panel in your rucksack. A lighter in your pocket can be augmented by a magnesium bar in your LBE and additional dry tinder in your rucksack.Your survival kit need not be elaborate. You need only functional items that will meet your needs and a case to hold the items. For example, you might want to use a bandage box, soap dish, tobacco tin, first-aid case, or another suitable container. This container should be:* Water-repellent or waterproof* Easy to carry or attach to your body* Suitable to accept various-sized components* DurableYour survival kit should be broken down into the following categories:* Water* Fire* Shelter* Food* Medical* Signal* MiscellaneousEach category should contain items that allow you to sustain your basic needs. For example, water: you should have items that allow you to scoop up, draw up, soak up, or suck up water; something to gather rainwater, condensation, or perspiration; something to transport water; and something to purify or filter water. Some examples of each category are as follows:**Fire*** lighter* metal match* waterproof matches* magnesium bar* candle,* magnifying lens**Water*** water filter like the [LifeStraw](LifeStraw)* non-lubricated condoms for carrying water* bleach* povidone-iodine drops* cravats* sponges* small plastic or rubber tubing* collapsible canteens or water bags**Shelter*** emergency shelter tube tent with paracord 550* parachute cord* large knife* machete or hatchet* poncho* space blanket* hammock* mosquito net* wire saw**Food*** knife ( can be the one on your MultiTool* snare wire* fishhooks* fish and snare line* bouillon cubes or soup packets* high-energy food bars* granola bars* gill or yeti net* aluminum foil* freezer bags**Medical*** oxytetracycline tablets (to treat diarrhea or infection)* surgical blades or surgical preparation knife* butterfly sutures* lip balm, safety pins* sutures, antidiarrheal medication (imodium)* antimalarial medication (doxycycline)* broad-spectrum antibiotics (rocephin and zithromax) and broad spectrum topical ophthalmic (eye) antibiotic* antifungal* anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen)* petrolatum gauze* soap> Note>> Medical items may make up approximately 50 percent of your survival kit.**Signal*** signaling mirror* strobe* pen flares* whistle* white flag* pilot scarf or other bright orange silk scarf* glint tape, flashlight, laser pointer, solar blanket**Miscellaneous*** duct-tape* wrist compass* needle and thread* money* extra eyeglasses* knife sharpener* cork
