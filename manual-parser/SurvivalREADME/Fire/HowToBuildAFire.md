There are several methods for laying a fire and each one has advantages.The situation you are in will determine which of the following fires to use.**TEPEE**To make a tepee fire ([Figure 7-5](#fig7-5)), arrange the tinder and a few sticks of kindling in the shape of a tepee or cone. Light the center. As the tepee burns, the outside logs will fall inward, feeding the fire. This type of fire burns well even with wet wood.**LEAN-TO**To lay a lean-to fire ([Figure 7-5](#fig7-5)), push a green stick into the ground at a 30-degree angle.Point the end of the stick in the direction of the wind. Place some tinder deep under this lean-to stick.Lean pieces of kindling against the lean-to stick.Light the tinder. As the kindling catches fire from the tinder, add more kindling.**CROSS-DITCH**To use the cross-ditch method ([Figure 7-5](#fig7-5)), scratch a cross about 30 centimeters (12 inches) in size in the ground. Dig the cross 7.5 centimeters (about 3 inches) deep. Put a large wad of tinder in the middle of the cross. Build a kindling pyramid above the tinder. The shallow ditch allows air to sweep under the tinder to provide a draft.**PYRAMID**To lay the pyramid fire ([Figure 7-5](#fig7-5)), place two small logs or branches parallel on the ground. Place a solid layer of small logs across the parallel logs. Add three or four more layers of logs, each layer smaller than and at a right angle to the layer below it. Make a starter fire on top of the pyramid. As the starter fire burns, it will ignite the logs below it. This gives you a fire that burns downward, requiring no attention during the night.<a name="fig7-5"></a>![Figure 7-5\. Methods for Laying Fires](fig07-05.png)**Figure 7-5\. Methods for Laying Fires**There are several other ways to lay a fire that are quite effective. Your situation and the material available in the area may make another method more suitable.
