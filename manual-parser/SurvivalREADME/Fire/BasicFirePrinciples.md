To build a fire, it helps to understand the basic principles of a fire.Fuel (in a nongaseous state) does not burn directly. When you apply heat to a fuel, it produces a gas. This gas, combined with oxygen in the air, burns.Understanding the concept of the fire triangle is very important in correctly constructing and maintaining a fire.The three sides of the triangle represent **air, heat,** and **fuel**.If you remove any of these, the fire will go out.The correct ratio of these components is very important for a fire to burn at its greatest capability.The only way to learn this ratio is to practice.
