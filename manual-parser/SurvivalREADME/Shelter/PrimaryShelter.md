Your primary shelter in a survival situation will be what you wear.
This point is true regardless of whether you are in a hot, cold, tropical, desert, or arctic situation.
For your clothes to protect you, they must be in a good condition and be worn properly.
I highly recommend getting your clothes from a local work-wear shop.
Since discovering this - the frequency I have to buy clothes dropped drastically.
Now I am getting most of my clothes in a work-wear shop.
If you are ever in Berlin - I highly recommend working dress at warschauer-strasse - a really friendly and fun man humbly selling high quality clothes and also alters/repairs them.
The only real exception for me are T-Shirts as I get them at conferences and other events.
This not only saves time - this also reduces waste.
And they are not only more durable - they are also more decoupled from fashion.
So If I have to replace a piece - I can usually just get the very same thing and do not have to select something new.
This way I also know it will fit well and can care for the things that are important to me.
I even go a bit further and have the same trouser 5 times so I do not even have to think about what to wear after waking up.
I just take the next clean trouser.
This also makes washing easier and uses less cognitive resources.
Knowing all the pockets all the time is also a big plus and the one I wear even has a nice mount-point for my MultiTool holster.
So it is easier to change than it would with a belt.
In a survival situation durable clothes are also a real plus as you might not be able to easily shop new ones.
