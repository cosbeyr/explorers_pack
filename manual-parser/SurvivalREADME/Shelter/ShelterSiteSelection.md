When you are in a survival situation and realize that shelter is a high priority, start looking for shelter as soon as possible. As you do so, remember what you will need at the site. Two requisites for shelter are that it must:* Contain material to make the type of shelter you need.* Be large enough and level enough for you to lie down comfortably.You should focus on your tactical situation and your safety when considering these requisites. You must also consider whether the site:* Provides concealment* Has escape routes.* Is suitable for signaling, if necessary.* Provides protection against wild animals and rocks and dead trees that might fall.* Is free from insects, reptiles, and poisonous plants.You must remember the problems that could arise in your environment. For instance, avoid:* Flash flood areas in foothills.* Avalanche or rockslide areas in mountainous terrain.* Sites near bodies of water that are below the high-water mark.In some areas, the season of the year has a strong bearing on the site you select.Ideal sites for a shelter differ in winter and summer. During cold winter months you will want a site that will protect you from the cold and wind, but will have a source of fuel and water. During summer months in the same area you will want a source of water, but you will also want the site to be almost insect free.When you are considering shelter site selection, remember the word BLISS and the following guidelines:* **B**lend in with the surroundings.* **L**ow silhouette.* **I**rregular shape.* **S**mall.* **S**ecluded location.
