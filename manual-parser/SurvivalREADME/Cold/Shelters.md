15-42\. Your environment and the equipment you carry with you will determine the type of shelter you can build. You can build shelters in wooded areas, open country, and barren areas. Wooded areas usually provide the best location, while barren areas have only snow as building material. Wooded areas provide timber for shelter construction, wood for fire, concealment from observation, and protection from the wind.**NOTE:** In extreme cold, do not use metal, such as an aircraft fuselage, for shelter. The metal will conduct away from the shelter what little heat you can generate.15-43\. Shelters made from ice or snow usually require tools such as ice axes or saws. You must also expend much time and energy to build such a shelter. Be sure to ventilate an enclosed shelter, especially if you intend to build a fire in it. Always block a shelter's entrance, if possible, to keep the heat in and the wind out. Use a rucksack or snow block. Construct a shelter no larger than needed. This will reduce the amount of space to heat. A fatal error in cold weather shelter construction is making the shelter so large that it steals body heat rather than helps save it.15-44\. Never sleep directly on the ground. Lay down some pine boughs, grass, or other insulating material to keep the ground from absorbing your body heat.15-45\. Never fall asleep without turning out your stove or lamp. Carbon monoxide poisoning can result from a fire burning in an unventilated shelter. Carbon monoxide is a great danger. It is colorless and odorless. Any time you have an open flame, it may generate carbon monoxide. Always check your ventilation. Even in a ventilated shelter, incomplete combustion can cause carbon monoxide poisoning. Usually, there are no symptoms. Unconsciousness and death can occur without warning. Sometimes, however, pressure at the temples, burning of the eyes, headache, pounding pulse, drowsiness, or nausea may occur. The one characteristic, visible sign of carbon monoxide poisoning is a cherry red coloring in the tissues of the lips, mouth, and inside of the eyelids. Get into fresh air at once if you have any of these symptoms.15-46\. There are several types of field-expedient shelters you can quickly build or employ. Many use snow for insulation.**SNOW CAVE SHELTER**15-47\. The snow cave shelter ([Figure 15-4](#fig15-4)) is a most effective dwelling because of the insulating qualities of snow. Remember that it takes time and energy to build and that you will get wet while building it. First, you need to find a drift about 3 meters (10 feet) deep into which you can dig. While building this shelter, keep the roof arched for strength and to allow melted snow to drain down the sides. Build the sleeping platform higher than the entrance. Separate the sleeping platform from the snow cave's walls or dig a small trench between the platform and the wall. This platform will prevent the melting snow from wetting you and your equipment. This construction is especially important if you have a good source of heat in the snow cave. Ensure the roof is high enough so that you can sit up on the sleeping platform. Block the entrance with a snow block or other material and use the lower entrance area for cooking. The walls and ceiling should be at least 30 centimeters (1 foot) thick. Install a ventilation shaft. If you do not have a drift large enough to build a snow cave, you can make a variation of it by piling snow into a mound large enough to dig out.<a name="fig15-4"></a>![Figure 15-4\. Snow Dwellings](fig15-04.png)**Figure 15-4\. Snow Dwellings****SNOW TRENCH SHELTER**15-48\. The idea behind this shelter ([Figure 15-4](#fig15-4)) is to get you below the snow and wind level and use the snow's insulating qualities. If you are in an area of compacted snow, cut snow blocks and use them as overhead cover. If not, you can use a poncho or other material. Build only one entrance and use a snow block or rucksack as a door.**SNOW BLOCK AND PARACHUTE SHELTER**15-49\. Use snow blocks for the sides and parachute material for overhead cover ([Figure 15-4](#fig15-4)). If snowfall is heavy, you will have to clear snow from the top at regular intervals to prevent the collapse of the parachute material.**SNOW HOUSE OR IGLOO**15-50\. In certain areas, the natives frequently use this type of shelter ([Figure 15-4](#fig15-4)) as hunting and fishing shelters. They are efficient shelters but require some practice to make them properly. Also, you must be in an area that is suitable for cutting snow blocks and have the equipment to cut them (snow saw or knife).**LEAN-TO SHELTER**15-51\. Construct this shelter in the same manner as for other environments. However, pile snow around the sides for insulation ([Figure 15-5](#fig15-5)).<a name="fig15-5"></a>![Figure 15-5\. Lean-to Made From Natural Shelter](fig15-05.png)**Figure 15-5\. Lean-to Made From Natural Shelter****FALLEN TREE SHELTER**15-52\. To build this shelter, find a fallen tree and dig out the snow underneath it ([Figure 15-6](#fig15-6)). The snow will not be deep under the tree. If you must remove branches from the inside, use them to line the floor.<a name="fig15-6"></a>![Figure 15-6\. Fallen Tree as Shelter](fig15-06.png)**Figure 15-6\. Fallen Tree as Shelter****TREE-PIT SHELTER**15-53\. Dig snow out from under a suitable large tree. It will not be as deep near the base of the tree. Use the cut branches to line the shelter. Use a ground sheet as overhead cover to prevent snow from falling off the tree into the shelter. If built properly, you can have 360-degree visibility ([Shelter, Figure 5-12](Shelter)).**20-MAN LIFE RAFT**15-54\. This raft is the standard overwater raft on U.S. Air Force aircraft. You can use it as a shelter. Do not let large amounts of snow build up on the overhead protection. If placed in an open area, it also serves as a good signal to overhead aircraft.
