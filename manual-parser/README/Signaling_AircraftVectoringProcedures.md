19-43\. To establish initial contact, use beacon for 15 seconds, use voice for 15 seconds (Mayday, Mayday, Mayday-this is call sign), then listen for 15 seconds. When you contact a friendly aircraft with a radio, guide the pilot to your location. Use the following general format to guide the pilot:

*  Call sign (if any).
*  Name.
*  Location (clock direction and distance from aircraft to your location).
*  Enemy disposition and location.
*  Number of people needing to be rescued.
*  Available landing sites.
*  Any remarks such as medical aid or other specific types of help needed immediately.
*  Give any guidance or steering corrections to the pilot from their perspective to remove any chance of error. For example, if the aircraft needs to turn left to pass over your position, tell the pilot to steer left. As he begins to come close to the correct heading, tell him to "roll out." Continue to make corrections as necessary to align the aircraft with you. Give the pilot estimates of distance from you as well, and be prepared to give a countdown to your position. Example: "You are one mile out... one-half mile out... you'll be over my position in ten seconds, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, mark." This will aid the pilot in estimating your range over the plane's nose. Remember that pilots may not be able to see straight down, only out in front of them at an angle depending on the aircraft design.

19-44\. Simply because you have made contact with rescuers does not mean you are safe. Follow instructions and continue to use sound survival and evasion techniques until you are actually rescued.
