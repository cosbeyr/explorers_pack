In contrast to the sun, generating power with your Bicycle is more effort but it can also be a lot of fun and serve as good exercise. And it might be easily available as most bikes already have a "generator" installed. Usually this "generator" / dynamo is there to power your lights on the bike. However, it can also charge a phone. You only need a converter to 5V/USB - you can build one yourself or buy one. Be careful here though - there are some really bad converters out there. I would recommend building one yourself.
