Converting from AC to DC (known as rectification) is easy and can be done with a single component. Almost every device that plugs into a mains socket will contain a bridge rectifier (AC->DC converter). This will be marked with these four symbols: '~ ~ + -' (any order, always four connectors).

Apply AC to the '~ ~' connectors and you will get DC form the '+ -' connectors.

Converting from DC to AC (known as inversion) is always much less efficient, and requires a complex device (power inverter) that cannot be improvised.
