First of all, self-defense is not about beating your opponent to death (not always), it's about all you need to do to get as less harm as possible. If you can run or talk someone down - no harm at all. If the only thing you can do to save your life is to kill someone - not to die. Second of all, I bet you don't think about the jurisdictional consequences when you imagine how you kick an attacker in the throat and he falls down not breathing. All harm you do to an assailant, regardless HE may be the one who attacked first, should be justified in a court by you or your advocate (it best be the advocate). Cause here's what you probably have never thought about: when you injure or murder an attacker the punishment is still almost the same as if it was you who's been murdered or injured until you prove that it was truly self-defense. And it might be really tough to do because even a single detail as the fact that you could've not approached a suspicious person or react to a drunk's offensive language can be a big problem when you try to legitimate your actions.
