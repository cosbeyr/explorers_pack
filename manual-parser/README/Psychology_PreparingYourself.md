Your mission in a survival situation is to stay alive. The assortment of thoughts and emotions you will experience in a survival situation can work for you, or they can work to your downfall. Fear, anxiety, anger, frustration, guilt, depression, and loneliness are all possible reactions to the many stressors common to survival. These reactions, when controlled in a healthy way, help to increase your likelihood of surviving. They prompt you to pay more attention in training, to fight back when scared, to take actions that ensure sustenance and security, to keep faith with your fellow team members, and to strive against large odds. When you cannot control these reactions in a healthy way they can bring you to a standstill. Instead of rallying your internal resources you listen to your internal fears. These fears will cause you to experience psychological defeat long before you physically succumb. Remember: survival is natural to everyone! Being unexpectedly thrust into the life-or-death struggle of survival is not. Do not be afraid of your "natural" reactions to this unnatural situation. Prepare yourself to rule over these reactions so they serve your ultimate interest: staying alive with honour and dignity.

Being prepared involves knowing that your reactions in a survival setting are likely to be productive, not destructive. The challenge of survival has produced countless examples of heroism, courage, and self-sacrifice. These are the qualities a survival situation can bring out in you if you have prepared yourself. Below are a few tips to help prepare yourself psychologically for survival. Through studying this manual and attending survival training you can develop the "survival attitude".

**KNOW YOURSELF**

You should take the time to discover who you are on the inside. Strengthen your stronger qualities and develop the areas that you know are necessary to survive.

**ANTICIPATE FEARS**

Don't pretend that you will have no fears. Begin thinking about what would frighten you the most if forced to survive alone. Train in those areas of concern to you. The goal is not to eliminate the fear, but to build confidence in your ability to function despite your fears.

**BE REALISTIC**

Don't be afraid to make an honest appraisal of situations. See circumstances as they are, not as you want them to be. Keep your hopes and expectations within the estimate of the situation. When you go into a survival setting with unrealistic expectations you may be laying the groundwork for bitter disappointment. Follow the adage: "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst". It is much easier to adjust to pleasant surprises about your unexpected good fortunes than to be upset by your unexpected harsh circumstances.

**ADOPT A POSITIVE ATTITUDE**

Learn to see the potential good in everything. Looking for the good not only boosts morale, it also is excellent for exercising your imagination and creativity. This is not only the case in a survival situation but through all of your life.

**REMIND YOURSELF OF WHAT IS AT STAKE**

Failure to prepare yourself psychologically to cope with survival leads to reactions such as depression, carelessness, inattention, loss of confidence, poor decision making and giving up before the body gives in. Remember that your life and the lives of others who depend on you are at stake.

**TRAIN**

Begin today to prepare yourself to cope with the rigours of survival. Demonstrating your skills in life will give you the confidence to call upon them should the need arise. Remember: the more realistic the training, the less overwhelming an actual survival setting will be.

**LEARN STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES**

People under stress have a potential to panic if they are not well-trained and not prepared psychologically to face whatever the circumstances may be. While you often cannot control the survival circumstances in which you find yourself, it is within your ability to control your response to those circumstances. Learning stress management techniques can significantly enhance your capability to remain calm and focused as you work to keep yourself and others alive. A few good techniques to develop include relaxation skills, time management skills, assertiveness skills, and cognitive restructuring skills (the ability to control how you view a situation). Remember, "the will to survive" can also be considered "the refusal to give up".
