**Leatherman**

There are a lot of options out there. I really like my [Leatherman OHT](OHTMultiTool).
I am carrying it most of the time when going out.

Basically just leave it at home when I want to go dance and jump around or have to go to a place with security which might have a problem with the tool as it contains a sharp knife. At some point I might buy a [Tread Bracelet MultiTool](TreadMultiTool) for these cases.

Also I like the story behind the company. There is a nice video with the [inventor on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJwyIF4VBTk). He wanted this tool and persisted in a very humble way. He is also proudly showing the durability in this video - really worth a look if you still have internet ;-)

**Victorinox**

Another option is Victorinox, the swiss provider of the Swiss Army Knife (along with Swiss owned Wenger company). With less diversity in the model shapes - two in fact, straight or ergonomic. Victorinox offers a serious selection of embeddable tools. One Recommendation is the SwissTool Spirit (the ergonomic one).
