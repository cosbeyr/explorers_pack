10-1\. Plants generally poison by:
*  _Contact._ This contact with a poisonous plant causes any type of skin irritation or dermatitis.
*  _Ingestion._ This occurs when a person eats a part of a poisonous plant.
*  _Absorption or inhalation._ This happens when a person either absorbs the poison through the skin or inhales it into the respiratory system.

10-2\. Plant poisoning ranges from minor irritation to death. A common question asked is, "How poisonous is this plant?" It is difficult to say how poisonous plants are because:
*  Some plants require a large amount of contact before you notice any adverse reaction although others will cause death with only a small amount.
*  Every plant will vary in the amount of toxins it contains due to different growing conditions and slight variations in subspecies.
*  Every person has a different level of resistance to toxic substances.
*  Some persons may be more sensitive to a particular plant.

10-3\. Some common **misconceptions** about poisonous plants are:
*  _Watch the animals and eat what they eat._ Most of the time this statement is true, but some animals can eat plants that are poisonous to humans.
*  _Boil the plant in water and any poisons will be removed._ Boiling removes many poisons, but not all.
*  _Plants with a red color are poisonous._ Some plants that are red are poisonous, but not all.

10-4\. The point is there is no one rule to aid in identifying poisonous plants. You must make an effort to learn as much about them as possible.
