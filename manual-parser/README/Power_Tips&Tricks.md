**Power-Bank**

Get a good power-bank. Often you do not want to use the energy directly while still generating it. Let's take solar - you may charge your power-bank during the day, and may use the power at night. Be aware that the capacity information on these power-banks are often inaccurate or outright lies. Try them out for yourself and measure.

Power banks are just batteries with standard plug interfaces (e.g. USB, 5V). Beware that owning a battery is like owning a pet animal: you're responsible for it. If you fail to comply with proper maintenance, it will have a shortened life. Classic cellphone power-banks are made of Lithium batteries, which are better stored at 50% capacity (being full or empty is damaging it), and recharge every 6 months. It won't work properly (or at all) after years of oblivion deep in a drawer.

**AC/DC Conversion**

Converting from AC to DC (known as rectification) is easy and can be done with a single component. Almost every device that plugs into a mains socket will contain a bridge rectifier (AC->DC converter). This will be marked with these four symbols: '~ ~ + -' (any order, always four connectors).

Apply AC to the '~ ~' connectors and you will get DC form the '+ -' connectors.

Converting from DC to AC (known as inversion) is always much less efficient, and requires a complex device (power inverter) that cannot be improvised.

**Save Power**

You do not have to generate the power you save. A big help in saving power is measuring what device consumes how much energy in which state. For example, your phone consumes a lot more energy when the radios (WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular) are switched on. Also, the brightness of the display plays a big role in its battery life.

You will use around 1% of your battery every minute of full power screen backlight, camera session, or WiFi download. And in uncovered areas, your phone will keep trying to reach a cellphone antenna around which drains a lot of power.

To save your battery you should set it up with low screen backlight level, short screensaver timeout and airplane mode enabled.

**Batteries**

There are 6 types of batteries you're likely to encounter in the wild:

* Alkaline [non-rechargeable] (typical 1.5V AA AAA C D 9V etc)
These are the typical batteries you'd use in a TV remote, or older portable electronic device.
They are at 1.5V to 1.7V at full charge and can provide a moderate-low amount of current.
The chemicals inside are non-hazardous for the most part. They contain no 'acid'.

Name brand 9V batteries often contain 6 AAAA cells in series, they can be used individually if need be.

* Zinc-Carbon [non-rechargeable] (typically 1.5V AA AAA 9V)
Cheaper batteries particularly 9V use Zinc-Carbon based cells.
They are 1.5V fully charged but are very low in total power and provide low current.
They also decay quickly when not being used, so older unused Zinc-Carbon batteries are usually near dead.
They are slightly irritating if you get the contents on your bare skin, but nothing to be alarmed about.

* Lithium Cell [non-rechargeable] (3V coin cell and cylinder in various sizes)
Coin cells are your typical watch batteries, hearing-aid batteries, small laser pointer batteries.
The most common use of Lithium 3V cylindrical cells are in home-security systems.
They have moderate total power, and can provide a moderate current.
They decay very slowly, so unused batteries, even 10 years old, are still good.
The contents of these batteries are not toxic, but pose a fire risk when exposed to air.
Do not recharge these batteries, they will burn. They do not leak at the end of their life. Most sources say they last 15 years. There are phone chargers which accept disposable batteries so these would work well with those charges for emergencies.


* Nickle-based [rechargeable] (1.2V AA AAA are most common)
These are typical rechargeable batteries encountered. They come in the same form as the alkaline batteries, but are rechargeable.
They provide a moderately-low total power, with a moderately-high current.
They discharge extremely quickly, unused fully charged nickle batteries will be death within a month.
The contents of NiCd batteries is very toxic and hazardous. Use care.
The contents of NiMH is much safer and poses little if any toxic hazard.

* Lithium-Ion [rechargeable] (3V-4.2V common cells are 18650, unlimited variation of shape+size)
These are the batteries found in phones, laptops, and almost any modern portable electronic device.
They provide high total power, and high current (sometimes limited intentionally)
They discharge slowly, and can stay charged for a year or longer.
The contents pose a fire hazard, especially when fully charged. Shorting the batteries can cause fire.
Explosions are extremely rare and unlikely.

* Lead-Acid [rechargeable] (6V and 12V most common, car batteries, vehicle batteries)
These are the best batteries for power storage, they can be found in cars and industrial flood lights.
They have moderately-high total power, and some can provide extremely massive currents (car batteries).
They decay at a moderate rate, but if kept stationary and at 100% charge by a constant trickle of slightly higher voltage, they can last indefinitely.
They require adding water to prevent them from drying out. Charging them slowly dries up the water inside.
They have serious hazards to watch out for. When dead, they contain water and lead. Lead is poisonous if ingested.
When charged, they contain sulfuric acid, which can burn you.
They will not survive being dropped or repeated physical shock.
